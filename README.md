### Guude! üëã
*This means (in my üá©üá™ mother dialect) "Hi, nice to see you."*

I'm Thorsten, an open source **voice technology enthusiast** from south Hessen in Germany. I contributed my personal voice in multiple voice datasets under CC0 licence so they can be used free and by everyone. In addition i trained multiple german AI based TTS (text-to-speech) models to synthesize **high quality german TTS without cloud or internet dependency - all on your local computer**.

You can get more details of my voice activity on the [Thorsten-Voice](https://www.Thorsten-Voice.de) project website and on my [Github repo](https://github.com/thorstenMueller/Thorsten-Voice).

**Use german TTS voice in your browser**

You can use my high quality german TTS voices free on Huggingface.

**Youtube**

On my [Thorsten-Voice youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ThorstenMueller) i share my knowledge about open voice technology. This includes step by step tutorials on how you run my Thorsten-Voice models locally on your own computer.
